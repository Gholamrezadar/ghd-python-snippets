## Snippets

  - [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
  - [Neural Networks](#neural-networks)
  - [Image Processing](#image-processing)

### Machine Learning

- **import_np_ghd_ml**: *Imports `np`, `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `os`, `datetime`*
- **timestamp_ghd_ml**: *Current timestamp as a variable. useful for naming files and etc*
- **timestamp_raw_ghd_ml**: *Returns current timestamp in-place. useful for naming files and etc*

### Neural Networks

- **import_tf_ghd_nn**: *Imports `tf`, `np`, `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `os`, `datetime`*
- **tensorboad_callback_ghd_nn**: *Generates a tensorboard callback with the current timestamp as the `log` directory*
- **tensorboard_start_ghd_nn**: *Loads tensorboard extension and launch tensorboard on `logs/` directory*

### Image Processing

- **opencv_utils_ghd_cv**: *Many small utility functions for OpenCV*
- **fourier_analysis_ghd_cv**: *Fourier analysis of an image*
- **fourier_filter_ghd_cv**: *Filter the Fourier spectrum of an image and return the filtered image*

## Requirements

Depending on what snippets you want to use, you may need to install additional modules.
